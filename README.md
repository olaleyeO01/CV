## Leye oduola

My name is Leye oduola and i am a aspiring software developer. I have completed my GCSE and A-levels and I am currently enrolled in makers. What i love about tech is that it is the future of the world and even seeing the changes right in front of our own eyes, and it is only just the beginning. It has endless oppertunites as it could be applied in any industry, I belive this is skill worth knowing and understanding.

## Work Experience

**Co-Co takeaway** (Sept 2017 to June 2019 )  
_customer service_

- My role was to deal with the customers orders and any inquirys they had regarding the food. When the store closes I would also clean the store to make the shop clean and fresh.

## Skills

I would say i am a good team player.

There was a situation where i was working and i could see a customer was being quite rude to one of the staff members. I could tell that my fellow staff members was very annoyed so I took the initiative and told my staff member to swap roles with me so i could handle that customers order so he dosen't have to deal with him,  which allowed my staff member to cool down and carry on being full productive for the day.
